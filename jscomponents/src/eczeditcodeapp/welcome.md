# Thanks for contributing!

On this page you can edit the information relating to a code in the error
correcting zoo database.  Your contribution is much appreciated.

# Please take note - download data file often

Please note that changes are not saved as you type.  Please click the *Download
data file* button regularly so that you save your work on your computer.  You
can always click *Load YAML file* to continue working on a data file you
downloaded at an earlier point in time.

Alternatively, you can prepare your text content separately, in your favorite
text editor, and then paste your text in the fields once you're ready.

# LaTeX-like mini-language

You can use some selected LaTeX commands in text fields.  Click on the
"LaTeX-like" tab above for more information.

# How to submit

Once you're ready, you can click *Download data file* one final time.  Then,
simply attach the downloaded file to an e-mail addressed as per the link
displayed at the bottom of this page.

Please allow some time for us to process your submission.

# By e-mail, really?

The error correction zoo is a completely static site, which significantly
simplifies its maintenance and reduces security risks.  Unfortunately this means
that we cannot automatically process uploads.

At this stage, attaching the downloaded file to an e-mail appears to be the
simplest method for everyone involved who would like to avoid getting involved
with git/github.  Sorry for the inconvenience; we're keen on finding a more
user-friendly solution in the future.

# Contribute via Github

You are of course welcome to submit the downloaded file instead as a pull
request on <a href="https://github.com/errorcorrectionzoo/eczoo_data/"
target="_blank">our repository on github.com</a>!
