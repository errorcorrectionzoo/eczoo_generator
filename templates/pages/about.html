<h1>The Error Correction Zoo collects and organizes error-correcting codes.</h1>

<p>Error correction is what ensures that the audio in your phone calls remains
sharp, your hard drives do not deteriorate too quickly, and signals can be
reliably transmitted to remote satellites.</p>

<p>Over multiple decades, and with the explosion of the information age, an
enormous variety of error-correction schemes were developed.  Recently, a
radically new type of error correction was introduced, one that can protect the
quantum information that is stored in a quantum computer or that is communicated
over a quantum network.</p>

<p>We created the <i>Error Correction Zoo</i> to categorize and to organize
known classical and quantum error-correction schemes.  It is inspired by other
similar zoos, including the <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/"
target="_blank">complexity zoo</a>,
the <a href="https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/" target="_blank">quantum algorithm
zoo</a>, the <a href="https://wiki.veriqloud.fr/" target="_blank">quantum protocol
zoo</a>, and the <a href="https://www.qubitzoo.com/" target="_blank">qubit zoo</a>.</p>

<p> Code entries form the primary content of the zoo.
  An entry can be a specific instance of a well-known code or a large family of codes, depending on community interest.
  The idea is to have a dedicated up-to-date webpage for each family, collecting original work, related protocols, and real-world implementations.
  Codes are organized into kingdoms by alphabet (Hilbert space structure) in the classical (quantum) case, with “parent” and “cousin” fields listing notable relations and connections.</p>

<p>A founding feature of the EC zoo is separation of data storage from presentation.
  Code information displayed in the zoo is stored in a structured form on <a href="https://github.com/errorcorrectionzoo/eczoo_data/" target="_blank">github.com</a>.
  This mechanism allows for the presentation of data in various ways, including through a <a href="https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/code_graph" target="_blank">code graph</a> and <a href="https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/lists" target="_blank">code lists</a>.
