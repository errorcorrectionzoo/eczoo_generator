<h1>The Error Correction Zoo collects and organizes error-correcting codes.</h1>

<p>Error correction is what ensures that the audio in your phone calls remains
sharp, your hard drives do not deteriorate too quickly, and signals can be
reliably transmitted to remote satellites.</p>

<p>Over multiple decades, and with the explosion of the information age, an
enormous variety of error-correction schemes were developed.  Recently, a
radically new type of error correction was introduced, one that can protect the
quantum information that is stored in a quantum computer or that is communicated
over a quantum network.
Quantum enhancements also help with classical
information transmission, yielding hybrid classical-quantum error-correction encodings.</p>

<p>We created the <i>Error Correction Zoo</i> to categorize and to organize
known classical and quantum error-correction schemes.  It is inspired by other
similar zoos, including the <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/"
target="_blank">Complexity Zoo</a>,
the <a href="https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/" target="_blank">Quantum Algorithm
Zoo</a>, the <a href="https://wiki.veriqloud.fr/" target="_blank">Quantum
Protocol Zoo</a>, and the <a href="https://www.qubitzoo.com/"
target="_blank">Qubit Zoo</a>. Other zoos include the <a href="https://rmzoo.math.uconn.edu/"
target="_blank">Reverse Mathematics Zoo</a> and the <a href="https://www.computability.org/zoo-viewer/"
target="_blank">Computability Zoo</a>.</p>

<p>Code entries form the primary content of the zoo.  
An entry can be a specific instance of a well-known code or a large family of codes, depending on community interest.
Each entry is processed into a dedicated up-to-date webpage for its code family, collecting original work, related protocols, and real-world implementations.</p>

<p>A founding feature of the EC zoo is separation of data storage from
presentation.  Code information displayed in the zoo is stored in a structured
form on <a href="https://github.com/errorcorrectionzoo/eczoo_data/"
target="_blank">github.com</a>.  This mechanism allows for the presentation of
data in various ways, including through
a <a href="https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/code_graph" target="_blank">code
graph</a> and <a href="https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/lists"
target="_blank">code lists</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy your visit! If you have feedback, please drop us a
